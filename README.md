# Fruitz Nūtz
## Introduction
Fruits Nūtz is an app that shows the nutrients in fruits. If you're curious about the different benefits of fruits, one can simply run the name of the fruit into the terminal and details about the fruit will be displayed.

## APP Logic

The app will start off by having a directory full of the names of fruits stored.
userInput() will trigger the return of nutrition based on the parameter of the user input.

## Backend
As of now the backend will consist of many *if statements* to scan through the data and push out a match.
I also want to store the many nutrition facts possibly in an array or simply a bunch of console.logs that run after a match is calculated. The backend will have one function 

## Frontend
The front end will consist of one function with a single parameter. The backend logic will be tied into at the top with a variable name that's identical to the declared back-end function. One variable will link the user's input.

## Stretch Goals
* If possible we can include the backend with another function that can show a plethora of other things. Health benefits, spiritual facts and we could even dive into the origin of a banana. 

* Surely a second parameter would be added to pinpoint what kind of *extra* facts one would like to see. For example:
**node fruits.js Banana Origin**
The second input could call from a library of data that contains origins of different fruit. 

* I'm not sure, but if we could add a image in the terminal to display the fruit, that would be great.
